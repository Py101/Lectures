    "is straightforward, and is used quite commonly. It allows you to use the class names directly in your program, so you have very clean and readable code. This can be a problem, however, if the names of the classes you are importing conflict with names that have already been used in the program you are working on. This is unlikely to happen in the short programs you have been seeing here, but if you were working on a larger program it is quite possible that the class you want to import from someone else's work would happen to have a name you have already used in your program. In this case, you can use simply import the module itself:"
